Using Typescript and the native DOM APIs (no jQuery or other DOM manipulation libraries), create a webpage that allows user input and shows the result of the following operations:
1. Given a list of numbers, calculate the sum of those numbers
2. Given a list of numbers, calculate their product
3. Given a string, calculate the count of the most used character.  Show both the count and the character that is most used.  For example, an input of “bill” would output “2 l”
